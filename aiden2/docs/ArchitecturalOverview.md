# Architectural Overview

## Introduction

Aiden 2 is a modern web application built using Create React App for the front end, Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, and TypeScript for type checking and improved developer experience. This document provides an overview of the architecture of Aiden 2.

## Front End - Create React App

The front end of Aiden 2 is built using Create React App. It is responsible for the visual presentation, user interactions, and intuitive design that complement Aiden 2's advanced capabilities. The main entry point of the application is `src/index.tsx`, which renders the `App.tsx` component.

The `App.tsx` component is the root component of the application. It renders the `AidenComponent.tsx`, which is the main component responsible for interacting with the user.

## Server-Side Rendering and Routing - Next.js

Next.js is used for server-side rendering and routing. The main entry points for Next.js are `src/pages/_app.tsx` and `src/pages/_document.tsx`.

The `_app.tsx` file is responsible for initializing pages. It can be used to keep state when navigating between pages.

The `_document.tsx` file is used to augment the HTML and body tags, which is useful for server-side rendering.

The `src/pages/index.tsx` file is the home page of the application. It renders the `AidenComponent.tsx`.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is used across all .ts and .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience. The TypeScript configuration is specified in `tsconfig.json`.

## Components

The `AidenComponent.tsx` is the main component of the application. It interacts with the `AidenService.ts` to handle the logic related to Aiden 2.

## Services

The `AidenService.ts` is responsible for handling the logic related to Aiden 2. It interacts with the `AidenComponent.tsx` and `AidenUtils.ts`.

## Utilities

The `AidenUtils.ts` provides utility functions used by `AidenComponent.tsx` and `AidenService.ts`.

## Styles

The styles for the application are defined in `src/styles/globals.css` and `src/styles/AidenComponentStyles.module.css`.

## Types

Type definitions are provided in `src/types/AidenTypes.ts`.

## Tests

Tests for the `AidenComponent.tsx` are provided in `src/tests/AidenComponent.test.tsx`.

## Documentation

Documentation for the project is provided in the `docs` directory. It includes setup instructions, architectural overview, API documentation, and usage guidelines.

## Conclusion

This architectural overview provides a high-level understanding of the structure and organization of the Aiden 2 application. For more detailed information, please refer to the individual files and their respective documentation.
